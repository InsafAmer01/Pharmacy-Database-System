# Pharmacy-Database-System
In this project i designed a Pharmacy management database system which was made to fulfill the requirements for a typical pharmacy. First since the client is an old pharmacy therefore has an old database system that doesnâ€™t support the development that the pharmacy has gotten to and the lack of information about it led to the use of paper at some point which obviously has led to the lose of data, and so the database system can hopefully help prevent this kind of bad situations from happening again.
By applying my knowledge to serve and find solutions for these kinds of problems easily and have more secure without the losing data. The database system can provide the best way for you to deal with both customers and medicines information. And have a pharmacy admin who can have access to the drugs status and information in terms of the number sold and remains to identify the inventories of sales and stocks and can handle the data needed in managing the pharmacy as well as managing the sales of medicines and customers records.
